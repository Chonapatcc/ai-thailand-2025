# Model-Only Responses Implementation

## Problem
The AIFT service was using hardcoded rule-based responses instead of calling the actual AI model, which limited the quality and variety of responses.

## Solution
Removed all rule-based responses and modified the AIFT service to use the actual AI model for all responses.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `lib/aift-service.ts`**:
   - **textqa() method**: Removed hardcoded responses dictionary and now calls `AIService.generateResponse()` with proper system and user prompts
   - **chat() method**: Removed rule-based response logic and now uses the actual model with context-aware prompts
   - **audioqa() method**: Updated to use model responses instead of mock responses
   - **vqa() method**: Updated to use model responses instead of mock responses

2. **Enhanced Model Integration**:
   - All methods now use `AIService.generateResponse()` for actual model responses
   - Proper system prompts for each type of interaction
   - Context-aware user prompts that include conversation history
   - Temperature and token limits for consistent response quality

### Key Features:
- **✅ Actual Model Responses**: All responses now come from the real AI model
- **✅ Context Awareness**: Chat method maintains conversation context
- **✅ Bilingual Support**: Model handles both Thai and English naturally
- **✅ Research Focus**: Specialized prompts for academic and research questions
- **✅ Consistent Quality**: Proper temperature and token settings for reliable responses

### Benefits:
- **Dynamic Responses**: No more static, predictable responses
- **Better Quality**: Real AI model provides more intelligent and contextual answers
- **Flexibility**: Can handle any type of question without predefined rules
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new capabilities without updating rule sets
- **Natural Language**: Model understands context and provides natural conversations

## Implementation Details:

### Text QA Method:
```typescript
// Uses AIService.generateResponse() with:
systemPrompt: 'You are Pathumma LLM, created by NECTEC...'
userPrompt: question
temperature: 0.7
maxTokens: 500
```

### Chat Method:
```typescript
// Uses AIService.generateResponse() with:
systemPrompt: 'You are Pathumma LLM... Use conversation context...'
userPrompt: `Context: ${context}\n\nUser message: ${message}`
temperature: 0.7
maxTokens: 500
```

### Audio/Visual QA:
```typescript
// Uses AIService.generateResponse() with specialized prompts for:
- Audio transcription analysis
- Visual content analysis
- Context-aware responses
```

## Testing
The updated service can be tested by:
1. Running the test script: `node test-aift.js`
2. Using the chat interface in the web application
3. Verifying that responses are dynamic and model-generated

## Files Modified:
- `lib/aift-service.ts` - Main AIFT service implementation
- `test-aift.js` - Updated test script for model responses
