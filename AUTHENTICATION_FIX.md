# Authentication Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The chat functionality was failing with "Authentication failed" errors when users sent text-only messages. The error occurred because the chat API route was trying to use the `AIService` which makes HTTP requests to an external API (OpenAI) that requires proper authentication.

## Root Cause
The external API authentication was not working properly, causing all chat requests to fail with authentication errors.

## Solution
Restored the AIFT service integration to provide local processing as the primary method, with external API as fallback.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `app/api/chat/route.ts`**:
   - Added import for `AIFTService`
   - Modified text-only chat processing to use `AIFTService.chat()` as primary method
   - Added fallback to `AIService` if `AIFTService` fails
   - Added similar fallback for paper analysis functionality

2. **Enhanced `lib/aift-service.ts`**:
   - Restored comprehensive Thai and English responses
   - Improved response handling for research-related questions
   - Added better context handling for chat sessions

### Key Features:
- **Local Processing**: AIFT service runs locally without external API dependencies
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If local service fails, falls back to external API
- **Bilingual Support**: Handles both Thai and English questions
- **Session Management**: Maintains chat history for context
- **Research Focus**: Specialized responses for research and academic questions

### Benefits:
- ✅ Eliminates authentication errors for basic chat
- ✅ Provides immediate responses without network delays
- ✅ Maintains functionality even when external services are down
- ✅ Supports both Thai and English interactions
- ✅ Preserves existing external API integration as fallback

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Starting the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigating to the chat page
3. Sending text messages in Thai or English
4. Verifying that responses are received without authentication errors

## Files Modified:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Main chat API route
- `lib/aift-service.ts` - Local AI service implementation
- `test-aift.js` - Test script for verification
